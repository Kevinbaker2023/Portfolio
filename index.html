            <p> Hi, my name is Kevin Baker and I am 24 years old. I am from Whittier, California and I currently work in a warehouse. I have 3 cats and 1 dog. I went straight to a 4 year
                university as a computer science major when I graduated high school. I had always been interested in how websites and apps work and what makes them run the way they do,
                and college was my first time learning any type of code. I dropped out of college because I wasn't 100% sure on what I wanted to do or what path I wanted to follow. I 
                always stayed interested in coding and during the pandemic my fiancee's brother completed a different coding bootcamp and speaking with him about programming made me
                realize that I wanted to do this as my career and I begin to look for a bootcamp that would fit with my schedule.
